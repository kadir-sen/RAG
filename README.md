# Forensic Delay Analysis Toolkit

A Streamlit-based preliminary delay analysis automation system for Primavera P6 projects.

## Prospective TIA workflow

Prospective mode uses one guided seven-step process:

1. Select Update & Connect AI
2. Register Event
3. Generate & Review Fragnet
4. Recommend & Validate Logic
5. Run Time Impact
6. Review & Explain Results
7. Export Report & Audit Trail

One XER is sufficient for a prospective TIA. Two or more revisions also
enable historical comparison. Bundled sample XER files can be loaded or
downloaded from Data Intake.

The API key is held in the active Streamlit session only. AI interprets
documents, drafts alternatives, recommends programme tie-ins and explains
results. Deterministic code validates IDs and logic and performs the pre/post
CPM comparison. The planner confirms every material decision. Source XER files
are never modified.

## Retrospective delay-analysis workflow

Retrospective mode offers one tab per module: intake & inventory, DCMA
health, baseline critical path, milestone shifts, planned vs as-recorded,
revision comparison, windows, S-curve, float erosion, resource loading,
as-built critical path (with method triangulation), sequence coding,
hierarchy rebuild, Explain This Delay, and the assembled report.

Recorded facts, deterministic calculations, AI candidates and analyst
conclusions remain separate. AI does not determine responsibility,
entitlement, excusability, compensability or concurrency.

## Features

- **Module 0: Data Inventory** — Intake & revision overview across multiple XER exports
- **Module 1: DCMA 14-Point Assessment** — Automated schedule assessment scorecard
- **Module 3: Milestone Shift Tracker** — Milestone movement analysis across programme revisions
- **Module 5: Baseline Critical Path** — Planned critical path via backward driving-logic trace or float-based identification
- **Module 4: As-Planned vs As-Recorded** — Variance analysis by activity code or WBS level (up to 4 dimensions)

All analyses produce:
- Interactive charts and tables
- Editable AI narratives (Claude/OpenAI/Gemini via API)
- Publication-ready Excel reports with colour-coded findings and caveats

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/delay-analysis-toolkit.git
cd delay-analysis-toolkit

# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Sample Data

Sample Primavera P6 exports are included in the `sample/` directory —
the fictional **Harbour Point DCP-03** district cooling plant EPC
project (fully documented, generated from one coherent network by
`sample/programmes/harbour_point_dcp03/build_programmes.py`):
- `Harbour Point DCP-03 - Baseline Programme Rev 0.xer` — 60-activity
  contract baseline, zero-float critical path, data date 08 Jan 2024
- `Harbour Point DCP-03 - As-Built Programme Rev 12.xer` — all
  activities complete, 12 Dec 2025 completion, **+92 calendar days
  late** with the delay story documented event by event in
  `sample/programmes/harbour_point_dcp03/README.md`

## Configuration

### API Keys for AI Narratives

If you want to generate narratives using Claude, OpenAI, or Gemini:

**Local:**
Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-..."
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "..."
```

**On Streamlit Cloud:**
1. Deploy the app first
2. Go to your app settings → Secrets
3. Paste the same config above

## Architecture

- `dcma/` — DCMA 14-point assessment engine (standalone, reusable)
- `programme/` — Programme-based modules:
  - `inventory.py` — Multi-revision intake
  - `milestones.py` — Milestone shift tracking
  - `critical_path.py` — Critical path extraction (longest-path & float methods)
  - `variance.py` — Group-based variance with multi-dimensional breakdown
  - `activity_codes.py`, `wbs.py` — Dimension helpers
  - `narrative.py` — Prompt builders for LLM narratives
  - `report_xlsx.py` — Excel workbook generation
- `app.py` — Streamlit UI (5 tabs, one per module)

**Design principle:** Deterministic Python engines → structured typed results → optional constrained LLM narrative.

## Deployment

### On Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Click "New app", select your repo, branch `main`, file `app.py`
4. Deploy

Free tier includes 1 app, sharing link, and automatic updates (push to GitHub = live).

### On Other Platforms

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for instructions for Railway, Render, Heroku, or self-hosted.

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
python test_programme.py
python test_engine.py
```
