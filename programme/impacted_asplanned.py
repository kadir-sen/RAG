"""Impacted As-Planned (baseline + event fragnets).

Distinct from the update-based prospective TIA: the analyst-confirmed
event fragnets are inserted into the ORIGINAL BASELINE (no progress) in
date order, and the movement of the modelled completion is measured
after each insertion. Recognised but WEAK method — the caveats say so
loudly; it is offered because contracts sometimes prescribe it and
because records are sometimes too poor for anything better.

Pure engine: baseline XerData + register records in, structured result
out (delegates the CPM to the calendar-exact cumulative-TIA engine).
