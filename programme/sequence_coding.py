"""Sequence Coding (propose-confirm work front × stage).

Where activity codes are incomplete and the WBS unhelpful, an analyst
recodes the programme to expose the construction sequence: a work-front
dimension (where the work is) crossed with a stage dimension (what kind of
work it is). This module automates the PROPOSAL of that coding from the
evidence in the file — activity-ID tokens, WBS fallback, and stage keyword
rules on activity names — and every assignment carries its evidence so the
analyst can confirm or override it. Nothing downstream runs on an
unconfirmable black box: the final mapping is a disclosed, editable table
that prints with the report.

Deterministic analysis on the confirmed mapping: actual-date bands per
(front, stage), the stage sequence per front, and the late-running fronts
that drove completion.
