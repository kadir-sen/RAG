"""Event extraction from correspondence and event narratives (TIA intake).

Reads letters / instructions / notices (txt, docx, pdf) or a pasted dated
narrative, and builds the prompt for an AI extraction pass that proposes
CANDIDATE delay events. The forensic rails are structural:

- Every candidate must cite its source document AND a VERBATIM snippet.
- The snippet is verified against the actual document text here, in code —
  a candidate whose quoted evidence cannot be found in its claimed source
  is DROPPED and counted, never shown as evidence.
- Candidates are proposals for the analyst's event form; nothing enters
  the register without the analyst adopting it.

Aligned with AACE RP 52R-06 (Prospective Time Impact Analysis): events
extracted here feed a TIA performed against the last accepted schedule
update prior to the event, with the fragnet kept to the fewest activities
practical.

No API calls in this module — prompt builders and strict parsers only.
