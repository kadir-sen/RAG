PRESENTATION RULES (apply to every section below)
- Tabulate first, narrate after. Markdown tables render as real tables in
  the Word export, so every section that has row data carries its table
  with the columns specified, then 2-3 sentences reading it.
- Show at most the FIVE most material rows per table — the data is
  supplied in that order. Where a category has more, state its TOTAL
  count in the sentence beneath and add: "the complete table is in the
  appendix workbook". Never imply the five shown are all of them; the
  appendix downloads alongside this narrative and carries every row.
- Figures verbatim from the data. Never invent, extrapolate or round
  beyond what is supplied; where a figure is absent say so rather than
  estimating it.

## As-Built Critical Path

### 1. Executive Summary
2-3 sentences: the milestone traced to, whether the works reached it,
the period the path spans, the basis adopted, and how far the chain is
corroborated by programmed logic rather than sequence alone.

### 2. How the Path Was Determined
State the adopted basis exactly as given (longest path of the as-built
programme, the actual recorded sequence, or an analyst election with
edits), and the composition:
| | Count |
|---|---|
| Activities on the path | |
| As-built (recorded) | |
| In progress at the data date | |

The path gantt is attached as a figure — refer to it here.

### 3. The Driving Chain
The path as a table, in execution order:
| # | Activity ID | Activity | Start | Finish | Basis |
then walk it as a construction story — stages of work, not an activity
list — giving the dates of the significant hand-offs.

### 4. Work Packages
Where a work-package grouping is provided:
| Work package | Members | On CP | Measured start | Measured finish | Driving member |
then state plainly that grouping is presentation and that each package's
dates come from its critical-path members only, so grouping cannot move
the measured delay.

State how many hand-offs follow a programmed relationship and how many
continue on sequence alone, then the weakest:

followed another without the programme ever linking them, and they need
contemporaneous corroboration.

finishing and the next starting. Report the periods and their length; do

## As-Planned vs As-Built Analysis

### 1. Executive Summary
2-3 sentences: the milestone(s) measured to, the as-built critical path
basis adopted, and the headline delay per milestone in calendar days.
The final gantt is attached as the leading figure — refer to it.

### 2. The As-Built Critical Path
How the path was defined (longest path of the as-built programme, the
actual recorded sequence, or the analyst's own selection — as stated in
the data, including any analyst edits), and the work packages it runs
through, in as-built order.

### 3. As-Planned vs As-Built, Package by Package
The comparison as a table, worst finish variance first:
| Activity / Package | Planned start | Planned finish | As-built start | As-built finish | Variance (d) |
stating the elected planned basis (late LS/LF or early ES/EF) above it,
then the construction narrative with the worst variances called out.

### 4. Key Dates & Analysis Windows
First state the measurement in one sentence: the delay at a key date is
its as-built finish minus its planned finish under the elected date
basis (calendar days, positive = late); windows run PROJECT START →
key date 1 → key date 2 → …, and the delay accrued in a window is the
change in that slippage across it. Then present the windows as a
markdown table with EXACTLY these columns:
| Window | From → To | Planned finish | Actual finish | Delay at key date (d) | Accrued in window (d) |
one row per window, figures verbatim from the data. Below the table,
explain each key date in turn: what it is, its planned vs actual date,
the delay at that date, and how much of it accrued in the window
leading to it. State which windows carry the delay and which recovered
time. A key date flagged RESEQUENCED was reached in a different order
than planned: report its direct delay normally but state that its
accrued-in-window figure carries a sequencing artefact.

A table:
| Milestone | Planned completion | As-built / forecast completion | Delay (d) | Achieved? |

on a record of what happened.

## Programme Revision Comparison

### 1. Executive Summary
3-4 sentences: the two revisions compared (with data dates), the movement
of the scheduled completion date between them, the overall volume and
character of the changes, and — where attribution data exists — whether the
movement traces to programme editing or to progress slippage.

### 2. Basis of Comparison
A table:
| | Earlier revision | Later revision |
|---|---|---|
| File | | |
| Data date | | |
| Scheduled finish | | |
then one line stating the completion movement in calendar days.

### 3. Scope Changes
A table of activities added and deleted:
| Activity ID | Name | Added / Deleted | Duration (d) | Start | Finish |
followed by 2-3 sentences on what areas of work they sit in (from the
names). If scope is unchanged, state that as a point of programme
stability and omit the table.

### 4. Logic & Sequencing Changes
One table for relationships added and removed:
| Predecessor | Type | Successor | Lag (d) | Added / Removed |
and one for lag changes:
| Link | Was | Now | Delta (d) |
then 2-3 sentences on what the re-sequencing amounts to. If the logic is
substantially unchanged, say the sequencing basis has been maintained.

### 5. Duration & Constraint Changes
A table of the duration changes, largest first:
| Activity ID | Name | Was | Now | Delta (d) |
and the constraint changes in a like table. Call out the largest
extensions and reductions in a sentence each.

### 6. Retrospective Changes to Actual Dates
CRITICAL SECTION. State the TOTAL number changed or removed in the first
sentence — that figure is the finding — then the five most material:
| Activity ID | Name | Was | Now | Delta (d) |
and point to the complete list in the appendix workbook. If there are none, state
explicitly that no actualised dates were altered — a positive indicator
for the contemporaneity of the records.

### 7. Materiality Screening
Where screening data is provided, the ranked changes as a table (top 20):
| Score | Path position | Category | Change | Detail |
with one sentence explaining the score's construction (path position +
magnitude + red-flag bonus) and one on where analyst attention should go
first. State plainly this is a screening, not a causation finding.

### 8. What Moved Completion
THE key section. Answer one question first, in bold, in one sentence:
**did the programme CHANGES move completion, or did the driving chain
simply fail to progress?** The data settles it — programme editing is
measured by reverting every revertible change together, and the remainder
is progress performance. Give the split as a table:
| | Days |
|---|---|
| Programme editing (all changes reverted together) | |
| Progress performance & un-modelled changes | |
| Total movement | |
and state the kernel completion of each revision.

Then the driving chain — what actually governs completion:
| # | Activity ID | Activity | Remaining (d) | Edited this window | On data date |
Where the chain is unchanged and rooted on the data date, say plainly
that the works on the governing chain did not progress and the chain
translated forward by the length of the window — the movement is
non-progress, NOT programme editing.

Then the individual changes tested one at a time:
| Change | Category | Completion with | Completion without | Contribution (d) |
figures verbatim, top contributors explained in a sentence each — e.g.
"reverting this lag change pulls completion from X back to Y". State
plainly that these were each tested against a programme where every other
change remains, so they interact and must NOT be summed — only the
editing-vs-progress split above sums to the total. Note how many changes
were not re-scheduled and why (completed side of the network, un-modelled
categories, test cap).

### 9. Change Provenance
Where provenance data is provided, the window matrix as a table:
| Window | Completion moved (d) | Retro actual changes | Top edit categories |
then state which window introduced the bulk of the editing, which moved
completion most, and where retrospective actual-date changes first appear.

completion-at-a-glance chart and the change-mix chart are attached to this

them in text.""",
