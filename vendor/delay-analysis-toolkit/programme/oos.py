"""Out-of-Sequence Screening & As-Built Logic Repair.

Standalone OOS module (the screening engine formerly embedded in the
comparison-impact module lives here now):

1. **Screening** — recorded actual dates that contradict the network's
   relationship types (`out_of_sequence_flags`), each flag carrying the
   as-built relation the actuals evidence (`rec_*` fields).
2. **Evolution** — each contradiction attributed to the update window in
   which it first appears (`oos_evolution`); disappearing contradictions
   are flagged as retrospective edits.
3. **Repair** — `build_repair_plan` turns the CONCRETE fits into an
   analyst-editable plan, and `apply_asbuilt_repairs` writes a COPY of
   the source .xer with those TASKPRED rows re-typed and re-lagged so
   the as-built logic is consistent with the recorded dates. The source
   file is never modified; 'review'-class flags (reversed as-built
   order, thin actuals) are NEVER auto-applied.

Pure engines: XerData / raw text in, structured results out. No LLM.
