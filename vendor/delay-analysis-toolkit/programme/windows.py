"""Windows / Period Movement Analysis.

For each window between consecutive data dates: how much the scheduled
completion moved, and how the driving (longest) path changed — which
activities joined and left the critical path between the two revisions.

This is the deterministic skeleton of a contemporaneous windows review: it
quantifies movement per period and shows where the driving path migrated,
without asserting causes. Pure engine: ordered XerData revisions in,
structured result out. No LLM.
