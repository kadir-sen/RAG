"""Concurrent-Delay Screening.

The most-litigated issue in delay disputes. This module SCREENS each
analysis window for time-overlap between Employer-asserted and
Contractor-asserted delay events, and flags windows where a pacing
enquiry is warranted. It deliberately stops at screening:

* overlap in TIME is necessary but not sufficient for concurrency — the
  legal tests (true concurrency, dominant cause, Malmaison, SCL
  approaches, apportionment) are contractual analysis outside this tool;
* responsibility is AS ASSERTED on each event by the analyst, never
  concluded by the engine;
* the pacing flag is a prompt to enquire, not a finding — a pacing
  defence needs contemporaneous evidence of a deliberate decision.

Pure engine: windows result + event register in, structured screening
out. No LLM.
