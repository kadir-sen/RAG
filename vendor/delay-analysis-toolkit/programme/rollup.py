"""Umbrella activities — work-package roll-up for as-built presentation.

An as-built critical path at activity level is unreadable in a report:
twenty rows of trunking, sleeves and containment say less than one bar
labelled "Electrical First Fix". This module rolls analyst-confirmed
groups of activities into UMBRELLA rows that carry the same shape as
``planned_vs_actual`` output, so every downstream consumer — the
comparison table, the as-planned/as-built gantt, key dates, key-date
windows and the workbook — works on them unchanged.

THE MEASUREMENT RULE (analyst election, deliberate and load-bearing):

    An umbrella's measured dates derive ONLY from members that sit on
    the adopted as-built critical path.

Grouping is a presentation device, and a presentation device must never
move the number. If "Electrical First Fix" contains three activities on
the critical path plus one snagging item that was never critical and
finished three weeks later, spanning all four would silently inflate the
measured delay by three weeks. Non-critical members are carried inside
the group — visible, exportable, drillable — but they cannot move the
bar that is measured. Their full span is retained separately as
``full_actual_*`` for presentation only, so the report can still show
the whole work package next to the measured portion.

Grouping may be AI-PROPOSED (prompt + strict parser below) but is never
AI-applied: proposals name verbatim activity codes, codes absent from
the programme are dropped and counted, and the analyst confirms every
umbrella before it enters a measurement.

Pure engine + prompt/parse helpers. No API calls, no LLM in the maths.
