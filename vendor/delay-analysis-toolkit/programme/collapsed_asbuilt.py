"""Collapsed As-Built (but-for) analysis.

Only requires the as-built programme. The as-built model is UNSTATUSED
(actual durations kept, actual dates released), rescheduled to validate
it reproduces the as-built completion, then the analyst-confirmed event
activities are removed (zero duration) and the model rescheduled again:
where the programme "collapses" back to is the but-for completion, and
the difference is the delay attributable to the extracted events.

The candidate-event grouping step may be AI-assisted (names / WBS /
activity codes -> proposed groups), but the extraction set is ALWAYS
analyst-confirmed and the collapse arithmetic is fully deterministic.

Pure engine + prompt/parse helpers. The LLM only proposes groupings of
verbatim activity codes; codes not present in the file are dropped.
