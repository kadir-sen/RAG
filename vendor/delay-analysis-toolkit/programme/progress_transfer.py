"""Progress Transfer.

Statuses one programme's network (the *network donor* — typically the
baseline or an earlier trusted update) with another programme's recorded
progress (the *progress donor* — typically a later update), then runs the
same calendar-exact simplified CPM used by the TIA engine on BOTH:

    transferred run : donor network + recipient's actuals
    reference run   : progress donor's own network + its own actuals

Because the progress is held identical between the two runs, the
difference in forecast completion is attributable to the NETWORK
differences between the files — which is exactly the quantity a
re-sequencing or covert programme edit tries to hide.

The effect is DECOMPOSED so that scope change is never conflated with
re-sequencing:

* **logic/duration effect** (the headline ``network_effect_days``) —
  computed on the INTERSECTION network: only activities present in both
  files, so added/deleted scope cannot contaminate the figure;
* **scope effect** (``scope_effect_days``) — the further movement that
  appears when the network donor's unmatched activities (work the other
  file no longer carries, modelled unstarted at full duration) are
  included.

Statusing choices (all disclosed as standing caveats):
  * retained logic — remaining work respects both the data date and its
    incomplete predecessors;
  * remaining durations for matched in-progress activities are taken
    from the progress donor (the recorded assessment of remaining work);
  * activities completed in the progress donor are removed from the
    remaining network, releasing their successors at the data date —
    the same simplification the TIA engine uses, so the two runs are
    method-consistent;
  * network-donor activities with no match in the progress donor are
    modelled as unstarted at full duration.

The output is an analytical comparison. It is NOT a schedule submission
and no impacted programme file is produced.

Pure engine: two XerData in, structured result out. No LLM.
