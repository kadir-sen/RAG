One paragraph: the period the revisions span and the update cadence
(regular/irregular, gaps).

For each missing input, state which analysis it constrains.

All data-quality warnings and caveats.""",

## Milestone Slippage Analysis

### 1. Executive Summary
2-3 sentences: the overall slippage picture across the tracked milestones,
naming the worst-affected milestone and its total shift.

### 2. Milestones On or Ahead of Programme
Milestones achieved on/before their original forecast, held stable across
revisions, or showing negative (favourable) shift — with figures. If none,
state that.

### 3. Key Milestone Movements
One bullet per milestone: total shift in days, the revisions between which
the largest movement occurred, and whether it is achieved or still forecast.

### 4. Observations on Trajectory
Only what the revision-by-revision dates show: is slippage accelerating,
stabilising, or recovering between data dates?

### 5. Unconfirmed Milestone Matches
List any proposed renamed/re-IDed milestones pending analyst confirmation.

All caveats provided, plus the standing note that shifts describe programme
forecasts, not proven delay causation.""",

Groups whose recorded dates are at or better than planned (zero or negative
deltas) — with figures. If none, state that.

### 3. Group-by-Group Variance
For each group with a computable delta: planned window, recorded window,
start and finish deltas in days. Order by finish delta, worst first.

Only patterns visible in the figures: do delays concentrate in particular
groups, do starts slip more than finishes, is any part of the works

## Baseline Planned Critical Path Review

### 1. Executive Summary
2-3 sentences: what the planned critical path runs through (from first
critical activity to completion), how many activities sit on it, and whether
it is continuous.

### 2. Path Narrative
Walk the critical chain in early-start order as a readable story: the
sequence of work fronts/disciplines it passes through, naming the key
activities and milestones with their planned dates. Group consecutive
activities into stages rather than listing every activity.

### 3. Path Integrity
Is the path continuous or broken into segments? Note any critical activities
with no logic ties to the rest of the path, and negative-float activities if
present. Where the path is sound, state that its continuity supports reliance
on the programme's critical-path logic.

### 4. Near-Critical Paths
The near-critical band: how many activities, which areas of work, and the
float margin separating them from the critical path — these are the paths
most likely to become critical if the plan moves.
