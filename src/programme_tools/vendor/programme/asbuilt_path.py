"""Module 12 — As-Built Critical Path (contemporaneous reconstruction).

Two deterministic, mutually reinforcing views of what actually drove the
works, both read from the project's own contemporaneous programmes:

1. **Stitched contemporaneous path** — for each window between data dates,
   the activities that were on the then-forecast longest path AND were
   actually performed during that window. Stitching those segments across
   windows reconstructs the as-built critical path as the contemporaneous
   records saw it (the observational approach; no analyst theory of what
   "should" have been critical is injected).

2. **Criticality persistence index** — for every activity, in how many
   revisions it sat on the forecast longest path while still to be
   performed. Activities critical in revision after revision form the
   empirical spine of the as-built path; activities critical only once are
   flagged as weakly corroborated.

Pure engine: ordered XerData revisions in, structured result out. No LLM.
